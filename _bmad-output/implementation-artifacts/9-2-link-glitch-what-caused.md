# Story 9.2: Link a Glitch to what caused it

Status: ready-for-dev

<!-- Created by bmad-create-story 2026-09-02. Story statement and acceptance criteria are transcribed verbatim from planning-artifacts/epics.md (status: final) - do not reword them here; a story needing a different criterion is a change to raise in epics.md. Epic 9: Incidents, recovery and Lost & Found. -->

## Story

As a **department manager**,
I want the jobs and rooms behind a failure attached to it,
So that glitch volume can be attributed rather than argued about.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Given** a Glitch
**When** I link Requests, Work Orders and Room records to it
**Then** each is navigable from the Glitch, and the Glitch is visible from each linked Job (FR-41).

**Given** linked Jobs over a period
**When** reporting runs
**Then** Glitch volume is attributable to Job types and Catalog Entries (FR-41, FR-73).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **T1. Link the causes** (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Requests, Work Orders and Room records linked to a Glitch, **navigable from the Glitch and visible from each linked Job**.
- [ ] **T2. Attributable volume** (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Linkage reportable so Glitch volume attributes to Job types and Catalog Entries (10.2).

## Dev Notes

**Prerequisites:** 9.1, 3.1/8.1 (the Jobs being linked), 2.1 (Room records).

**Scope guards.** Linkage and its reportability. Not root-cause classification (9.5 — a judgement about *why*, distinct from *what was involved*).

**Bidirectional navigation is the requirement.** A supervisor opening a Job should see that it contributed to a Glitch; a manager opening the Glitch should reach the Jobs. One-way linkage is the common shortcut and it makes the Job side useless — which is where the operational conversation actually happens.

**Implementation notes.**
- Model as a relationship with a type (`caused_by`), not as an array of ids on the Glitch, so the Job-side query is an index lookup rather than a scan.
- Attribution to Catalog Entries (10.2) comes through the linked Job's entry — do not denormalise the entry onto the Glitch.
- Links are audited like other state changes (1.11).

**Testing.** Link each of the three record types; assert navigation both ways. Attribution query grouping Glitch volume by Catalog Entry. Unlink recorded. Cross-property link attempt refused (isolation gate).

### Project Structure Notes

Extends `core/incident/` with the link relationship; read models on both sides.

## Standing constraints (identical in every story — the dev agent has only this file)

**Vocabulary is binding and verbatim in code.** `Job` (umbrella), `Request` (guest-originated), `WorkOrder` (maintenance), `RoomAssignment`, `Credits`, `Stay`, `Glitch`, `Recovery`, `Asset`, `Discrepancy`, `Tenant`, `Property`, `Shared Device`, `Catalog Entry`, `SLA Target`, `Pause Condition`, `Escalation chain`. **Never `ticket` or `task` in any identifier**, including tests and table names. A `RoomAssignment` is deliberately *not* a `Job` — it has no SLA Clock. A `Stay` is a projection of Jazz Core truth, never authored here.

**Architecture invariants (read-only, original ids).** AD-1 event-sourced Job core, SLA derived never stored · AD-2 `occurred_at` (domain clock) vs `recorded_at` (system clock) · AD-3 every row and event carries `tenant_id` and `property_id` · AD-4 regional cells, a Property never leaves its region, control plane holds no guest data · AD-5 one Jazz Core port with one owner · AD-6 cleanliness ours, occupancy Jazz Core's · AD-7 offline is a first-class write path, server-enforced idempotency on `(tenant_id, property_id, staff_member_id, client_key)` for 30 days · AD-8 notification intents in the domain, delivery in adapters, suppression evaluated once · AD-9 configuration versioned and effective-dated, a Job keeps its bound version for life · AD-10 guest data minimised **at ingestion** · AD-11 permission is a server decision; the interface only hides what the server would refuse · AD-12 one localisation and direction contract · AD-13 one writing owner per aggregate · AD-14 one SLA fold (TypeScript) plus exactly one Dart port, both fixture-gated.

**Layering.** `core/` pure domain, no I/O and no clock of its own · `core/ports/` interfaces · `adapters/` one per external reality · `app/` handlers, projections, sagas · `edge/` HTTP, sync, auth, tenancy · `clients/mobile` (Flutter/Dart) and `clients/console` (React/TS). Dependencies point **inward only**; a client never reaches an adapter or the datastore directly. Story 1.0's lint enforces this — keep it green.

**Conventions.** Events past tense, domain-first, one per real-world fact · ULIDs for what we create; Room numbers and Jazz Core ids are external strings, never re-keyed · UTC RFC 3339, Property timezone is presentation only · money as minor-unit integers plus ISO-4217, **no conversion in v1** · one error envelope (`code`, localisable `message` key, `retryable`) · commands are POSTs returning the accepted event, reads are projections, sync is one endpoint taking a batch of intents · configuration is versioned records, **never environment-variable feature behaviour** · secrets from the platform secret store, never on a device · structured logs carry tenant, property, actor, correlation id and the Jazz Core exchange id — **guest identifiers are never logged**.

**Release gates that apply to this story but are not its acceptance criteria.** Cross-tenant isolation (AD-3/DG-1) · the two-language SLA fixture suite (AD-14) · contract-codegen drift, since `contracts/` is the schema of record and no wire type is hand-written on either side · the per-intent offline conflict-rule suite (AD-7). All four were stood up in **Story 1.0**; extend them, never bypass them.

**If this story touches a client surface**, these are acceptance criteria, not polish: state distinctions survive **greyscale** and are legible at arm's length in low light (NFR-6) · **logical direction only** — no left/right in layout; Arabic ships in R1 (AD-12) · identifiers and clock times render in **Western digits inside a bidi isolate, with any adjacent separator inside the isolate** · core actions are tap-only (gloves) and reachable one-handed in the thumb zone on the baseline device (Android 10 / iOS 15 / 3 GB) · one primary action per screen, destructive actions never in the thumb zone · colour, spacing and type come from `DESIGN.md` tokens — accent petrol `#27565D` on white ink, cyan `#08FCFF` is a highlight and never a button ground · a surface showing Jazz Core-sourced context names the last successful exchange when stale · **render it and check it in greyscale before calling it done** — that habit caught a missing glyph, a wrapping label, dead space on eight surfaces, a selection style masking priority state, and an Arabic bidi bug that turned 19 minutes into 190.

**Testing baseline.** Domain unit-tested with a **fake clock and fake ports** — a domain test that needs a database means the dependency arrow is wrong. Use fake clocks for anything time-dependent; never real sleeps. Add every new aggregate and public interface to the cross-tenant isolation suite.

**Unverified stack.** Every version in the architecture spine's Stack table is `[ASSUMPTION]` — produced from training knowledge with web access blocked. Story 1.0 owns confirming them. Do not treat a version as settled, and report any divergence rather than adopting it silently.

**This story file is derived from `status: final` documents.** Its acceptance criteria are transcribed verbatim from `planning-artifacts/epics.md`. A story that needs a different criterion is a **change to raise there**, not to reinterpret in code. Tasks may be added under an existing AC; ACs may not.
